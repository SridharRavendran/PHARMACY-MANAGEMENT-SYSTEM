# PHARMACY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
A small pharmacy wants to develop a system to maintain their stock of medicines and track the daily sales. A salesperson should be able to input the required medicines from a prescription and generate an invoice for the same. The system should indicate to the salesperson, the bins where each required medicine is available. The management should be able to track their daily/weekly/monthly/annual sales and stock. The system should generate alerts when a medicine is about to expire. Alerts should be generated when a medicine is going to be out of stock.
